Duke: Bob! What did you do? The cats went everywhere!
Duke: I specifically asked you to bring me Kuura the Cat  from the outside, but now there are hundreds of them!
Duke: You pressed the wrong button? There are two buttons on the machine, and you’re telling me you pressed the wrong one? Unbelievable…
Duke: Talk to the Barons, and see if they need your help with cleaning this mess up. The kitties can live in your house for now.
Duke: Yes, I am fully aware that I have a huge castle...
Duke: I can’t have a bunch of kitty cats running around making a mess of the place!
Duke: Besides, I’m super busy being the boss and doing boss stuff right now.
Duke: ... So you’ll have to take care of them.
Duke: First you need to go collect some magic dust so you can buy food for the cats. After that, you can try to find the rest of the little creatures.
Duke: Get to work!
