Baroness of the Warehouse: "Hello? Mister Bear Lord, sir?"
Baroness of the Warehouse: "Yes, Bob is helping me clear out the cats from the warehouse. T-thank you for sending him over."
Baroness of the Warehouse: "Well... I guess he could work a bit faster. B-but he is probably doing the best he can!"
Baroness of the Warehouse: "Uh, ok. I'll tell him to pick up the pace then. B-bye."
